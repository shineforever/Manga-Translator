## 🔍 Technical Principles

### AI-Driven Translation Engine

This tool employs cutting-edge neural network translation systems that not only understand word meanings but also capture contextual nuances, ensuring natural and fluent translation results. The system first "reads" the entire manga, grasping the overall style and character traits, then produces cohesive and consistent translations.

![Translation Engine Architecture](./images/宣传图003.png)

### OCR Text Recognition Technology

To address the unique layout challenges in manga, we've developed a specialized Comic Text Detector that can precisely identify:

- Vertical and horizontal text
- Handwritten-style fonts
- Special effect fonts and onomatopoeia
- Small background text and annotations
- Decorated speech bubbles

The recognition accuracy reaches an industry-leading 99%, accurately extracting text even in complex backgrounds.

### Layout Preservation Mechanism

After translation, the system intelligently adjusts font size, line spacing, and layout to ensure the translated text perfectly integrates into the original bubbles and layout. Key technologies include:

1. **Intelligent Typesetting Algorithm**: Automatically adjusts font size and line spacing based on target language text length
2. **Background Restoration Technology**: Intelligently restores the background after removing the original text
3. **Style Matching**: Maintains consistent font style and expressiveness with the original manga
